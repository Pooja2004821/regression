        "- Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical technique used in predictive modeling to understand the relationship between two continuous variables :\n",

        "1. Linearity : The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is linear.This means that the effect of X on Y is constant.\n",
        "- Check : Scatter plot of X vs Y should show a straight-line trend.\n",
        "2. Independence of Errors : The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other.No correlation between consecutive error terms (especially important in time-series data).\n",
        "- Check : Durbin-Watson test (values between 1.5 and 2.5 are generally okay).\n",
        "3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors) : The variance of residuals (errors) should remain constant for all values of X.\n",
        "- Check : Residuals vs. Fitted values plot — the spread should be even.\n",
        "4. Normality of Errors : The residuals should be normally distributed, especially important for inference (confidence intervals, hypothesis tests).\n",
        "- Check : Histogram or Q-Q plot of residuals.\n",
        "5. No (or minimal) multicollinearity : In Simple Linear Regression, this is not a major concern (since only one predictor exists), but in Multiple Linear Regression, predictors should not be highly correlated with each other.\n",
        "6. No significant outliers or influential points : Outliers can distort the regression line.\n",

        "- If a Multiple Linear Regression model has a high R² but low adjusted R², it usually indicates overfitting due to the inclusion of irrelevant or non-significant predictors.\n",
        "- Let's break it down :\n",
        "- R² (Coefficient of Determination) : Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.Always increases or stays the same when more predictors are added—even if they’re useless.\n",
        "- Adjusted R² : Adjusts for the number of predictors in the model.Penalizes unnecessary predictors that don't improve the model substantially.Can decrease if you add variables that don’t help explain the dependent variable.\n",
        "- What it means when : R² is high: The model appears to explain a large portion of the variance.Adjusted R² is low: Many of those predictors might not be contributing meaningfully—possibly just adding noise.\n",
        "- Interpretation : The model may be overly complex and include predictors that do not actually improve prediction accuracy.\n",

        "Q22.Why is it important to scale variables in Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "1. Regularization is used : If you're using variants like Ridge or Lasso Regression, scaling is essential.These methods penalize large coefficients to prevent overfitting.If variables are on different scales, the penalty unfairly affects those with naturally larger scales (e.g., salary in lakhs vs. age in years).Standardization (z-score scaling) ensures that each variable contributes equally to the regularization term.\n",
        "2. Improves interpretability of coefficients : Scaling makes it easier to compare the relative importance of features.For example, knowing that a one standard deviation increase in variable A has more effect than the same increase in variable B gives useful insights.\n",
        "3. Numerical stability and faster convergence : Algorithms used for solving the regression (like gradient descent in large datasets) perform better when features are on similar scales.Helps avoid ill-conditioned matrices when computing the inverse of the covariance matrix in the normal equation method.\n",

        "2. When a linear model underfits the data : If a linear regression model performs poorly (low R², patterned residuals), a polynomial model may reduce bias and better capture the complexity of the data. Example : Modeling sales over time with seasonal patterns.\n",
        "3. When you suspect diminishing or increasing returns : In economics and marketing, effects like diminishing returns or increasing effects over time can be modeled using quadratic or cubic terms.Example : The impact of advertising spend on sales – small spend has big impact, but after a point, more spend has little added effect.\n",

        "1. Overfitting : As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model becomes overly complex and starts fitting the noise in the data instead of the true pattern.This leads to poor generalization on new or unseen data\n",
        "2. High Variance : Higher-degree polynomials can lead to large swings or wild fluctuations between data points, especially at the boundaries (called Runge's phenomenon).This makes predictions unstable and sensitive to small input changes.\n",
        "3. Difficult to Interpret : Coefficients of polynomial terms are hard to interpret compared to simple linear models.It becomes unclear what each variable or interaction actually represents.\n",

        "5.

        "Q29. What methods can be used to evaluate model fit when selecting the degree of a polynomial?\n",
        "1. Train-Test Split / Cross-Validation : Split the data into training and testing sets (or use k-fold cross-validation) to evaluate how well the model generalizes.Try different polynomial degrees and select the one that gives the lowest error on the validation/test set, not just the training set.Metric to use: MSE, RMSE, or R² on validation set.\n",
        "2. Mean Squared Error (MSE) / Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) : Compute the MSE or RMSE for models of various degrees.A sharp decrease followed by a plateau or increase indicates the point beyond which higher degrees lead to overfitting.\n",
        "3. Adjusted R² : Unlike R², which always increases with more terms, Adjusted R² penalizes unnecessary complexity.Choose the degree that maximizes adjusted R² — it indicates better fit without adding irrelevant terms.\n",
        "4. Residual Plots : Plot residuals (errors) vs. predicted values.A random scatter suggests a good fit.A pattern or curve in residuals implies underfitting (use higher degree), while excessive noise might suggest overfitting.\n",
        "5. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) / Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) : Both AIC and BIC penalize model complexity (more terms = higher penalty).Lower AIC or BIC values indicate a better model in terms of balance between fit and simplicity.\n",
        "6. Learning Curves : Plot training and validation error vs. model complexity (degree).Helps visualize whether increasing degree reduces bias or just increases variance.\n",

        "1. To Understand the Model Fit : Visualizing the predicted curve against the actual data points shows how well the model captures the relationship.You can immediately see if the polynomial is underfitting (too flat) or overfitting (too wiggly).Example : A linear fit may miss curvature that a quadratic or cubic curve reveals visually.\n",
        "2. To Compare Different Polynomial Degrees : Plotting curves of various degrees (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10) helps visually compare which one best captures the trend without going extreme.It allows you to choose the simplest model that fits well, avoiding overfitting.\n",
        "3. To Detect Overfitting and Underfitting : A high-degree polynomial might fit the training data perfectly but look unnatural or erratic, especially near the edges (Runge’s phenomenon).Visualization can highlight when the model is too complex or too simple.\n",
        "4. To Analyze Residual Patterns : Plotting residuals (actual - predicted values) helps identify whether the errors are randomly scattered (good) or show patterns (bad).Patterns in residuals indicate the model isn't capturing some structure in the data.\n",
